Implement `specs/$ARGUMENTS/SPEC.md`. Done means every item under
`## Acceptance Criteria` is met.

Resolutions under `Open Questions / Risks` are decided — build on them, don't
re-open them. If the approach fails mid-build, re-plan against `Requirements`;
the goal holds even when the design changes.

For the visual reference, read `specs/$ARGUMENTS/design.html` if it exists — a
read-only, static snapshot of the locked design, a few KB of plain HTML. **Do
not `cat` or read `prototype.html` or any `.dc.html` canvas file**; those bundle
the design-canvas editor runtime (2.5 MB in one case) and reading one floods
this session's context. If `design.html` is missing, work from the `SPEC.md`
prose and the `## Prototype` section of `discovery.md`; do not open the canvas.

## First: check whether this is already partly built

You may be running on a branch that already holds work — a previous attempt that
was interrupted, or one that is being resumed. Before writing anything, look: if `specs/$ARGUMENTS/implementation-notes.md` exists, or source
files the spec calls for are already there, **treat the spec as partially or
fully built.**

In that case the job is to *close the gap*, not to start over. Read the notes
and the existing code, check them against `SPEC.md`, and implement only what is
missing or wrong. Re-implementing from scratch on top of working code throws
away a previous session's reasoning and routinely reintroduces exactly the
deviations that notes file was written to record.

If the existing work looks complete, say so plainly and verify it against the
spec rather than manufacturing changes to look busy — the verification phases
that follow are what decide whether it is actually done.

If the spec's Steps say `Task list: yes`, keep a checklist in
`specs/$ARGUMENTS/TASKS.md`. Tick each item when it's done, and add anything new
you find.

Keep `specs/$ARGUMENTS/implementation-notes.md` current for the whole task.
If an edge case forces you off the plan: take the conservative option, append
one line under `## Deviations` (what changed and why), continue.
Do not log changes that match the plan.

If you edit `SPEC.md` itself, bump its `Updated:` line to today.

When a framework or API does not behave the way you expected — an error whose
cause is not obvious, a call that needs setup the docs in your head do not
mention — search the web before working around it. Here, unattended, an
invented workaround becomes a QA failure later at several times the cost, and a session with no memory of this moment gets to debug it blind.
Prefer the official documentation and the project's issue tracker, note what
you found under `## Deviations`, and move on. Keep it to a search or two: this
is for genuine unknowns, not a substitute for reading the code in front of you.

When you change code that can be run, built, or type-checked, and the project
states how to check it — the commands in `CLAUDE.md`, a documented test or
build script — run that check before reporting the change done. A syntax-only
check, or a check command that failed to start, does not count. Run only what
the project itself states: install nothing, and do not hunt for or invent
another way to check. If the project states no check, or the stated one cannot
run here, do not report the change as done. Say which check you did not run and
why, and leave it to the user.

End your final message with three headings, in this order: **Blocked on me** — a
decision you left open or a change you want approved; **Changed**; **Found**.
